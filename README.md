# Xamarin-Forms-Starter

This is a very simple starter project for xamarin forms used for personal projects

This has some core projects that can be used for sharing code between different apps

Tried to keep minimum dependencies
- [Mobile Center](https://github.com/Microsoft/mobile-center-sdk-dotnet)
- [Settings Plugin](https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/SettingsPlugin)

There are plently more of [Open Source Components for Xamarin](https://github.com/xamarin/XamarinComponents)
